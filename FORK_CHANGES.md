# What this fork changes

This repository is a fork of [pingdotgg/t3code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code). This file lists everything the fork adds on top of upstream and where each change lives. Update it whenever a patch branch or fork workflow changes. The patched-release workflow also gives this file to the AI agent that reconciles patches with upstream, so each entry says what the change is for as well as what it does.

## How the changes ship

- `nowbar` (default branch) carries the Android Now Bar work and the fork's CI. It merges `upstream/main` by hand.
- Desktop and server changes live on patch branches based on `upstream/main`. The patched-release workflow cherry-picks them, in the order below, onto every upstream nightly and publishes the result here under the same version number.
  - The Linux desktop AppImage updates itself from this repository's releases.
  - Servers whose service sets `T3CODE_RELEASE_BASE_URL=https://github.com/Ta-noshii/t3code-nowbar/releases/download` install the patched runtime through the normal in-app Update.

## Patch branches (desktop and server)

### `patch/edit-fork`

Claude Code history tools that upstream lacks.

- **Fork a thread / edit a message in a new thread.** "Fork from here" on any message, and "Edit" on a user message, open a new thread containing the history up to that point. For Claude, the new thread gets a real copy of the Claude session (the SDK's `forkSession`, cut at the matching message), so the agent keeps its context. Providers without session forking get the earlier messages as an attached `earlier-conversation.md`. Server RPC `orchestration.forkThread`, capability `threadFork`.
- **Older Claude threads.** Threads recorded before turn boundaries were stored still fork correctly; the cut point is found from the message ids in the Claude transcript.
- **Copy a chat to another machine.** The environment chip in the composer is always shown, including on the local machine. On a started chat it opens a menu listing the machine the chat runs on, then one submenu per other connected environment with its projects. Picking a project asks for confirmation, then creates a copy of the chat on that machine.
  - Both machines on a patched build: the source exports the thread (`orchestration.exportThread`) and the target imports it (`orchestration.importThread`, capability `threadTransfer`). Claude sessions travel as a gzipped export of the session store, subagent transcripts included, and are written into the target's Claude home as a fork. The copy shows the full history and the agent remembers it.
  - Target without the import RPC, or a provider without session export: the copy starts with a first message that carries the conversation and asks the agent to summarise where things stand, so the agent picks the work up without the user resending anything.
  - The copy works in the target project's main folder, since the source's worktree exists only on the source machine.
- CI tests: `apps/server` `forkThread.test.ts`, `transferThread.test.ts`, `claudeHistoryWorker.test.ts`, `ClaudeAdapter.test.ts`; `apps/web` `ChatView.logic.test.ts`, `BranchToolbar.logic.test.ts`.

### `fix/hyprland-snapshot-flight-sizing`

Upstream PR [pingdotgg/t3code#11591](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/11591), carried until it merges. With capture animations on, the SnapShots flight from the window to the draft drew an oversized, stretched rectangle on Hyprland, because Hyprland 0.56.2 updates a surface's size only when a buffer is attached. The fix reattaches the capture buffer on every visible flight frame, while full damage stays gated on a texture change. CI test: `native/hyprland-snap-shot` `cargo test`.

When the PR merges, delete the branch. The workflow skips branches that no longer exist, and commits upstream already has drop out as empty cherry-picks.

## Android (on `nowbar`)

- **Samsung Now Bar agent monitoring.** The Android app shows agents in Samsung's Now Bar, with a distinct state per agent status, and keeps unread results. It handles attention, privacy and notification settings, keeps the bar fresh when React Native timers pause, and stops monitoring once every environment disconnects.
- Custom Now Bar cards delivered through private host push, expanded cards with live agent updates, layout and text fixes, and a Now Bar state lab.
- Signed fork updates: the app updates from this repository's releases instead of upstream's.
- Workflow `nowbar-release.yml` syncs upstream and builds the signed APK. It passes `-R "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY"` to `gh`, because the checkout has an `upstream` remote that `gh` would otherwise pick.

## Fork CI

- `patched-release.yml` runs every 4 hours and builds the newest upstream nightly that has no patched release yet. Stable versions build only when started by hand. For each version it:
  1. installs dependencies on the upstream tree,
  2. cherry-picks the patch branches, asking the Cursor CLI agent to resolve any conflict,
  3. typechecks the server and web apps and runs the tests above, asking the agent to fix failures (up to two rounds),
  4. builds the Linux AppImage and the server archive and publishes release `v<version>`, keeping the newest five.

  When the agent changed anything, the release notes say so and the release carries `ai-reconciliation.patch`. Fold that diff into the patch branch so later builds apply cleanly. The agent needs the repository secret `CURSOR_API_KEY`; without it, a conflict or failed check stops the build as before.
- The release tags the `nowbar` commit the workflow ran from, not the patched tree. The workflow token may not push a commit that edits upstream's `.github/workflows` files.
